        - **Data Sources:** Anonymized data is sourced from routine health information systems, community health worker reports, and geospatial databases. 
          For this demonstration, synthetic data is used.
        - **Risk Scoring:** AI-driven risk scores are generated using predictive models that consider various health and socio-demographic factors (simulated in this demo).
        - **Privacy:** All data displayed is aggregated or anonymized to protect patient privacy in a real-world scenario.
        - **Updates:** In a production system, data would be updated regularly (e.g., daily or weekly) to ensure timeliness.
